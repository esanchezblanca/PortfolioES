                Hi, I am Elena SÃ¡nchez. </br>
                Translator and Front End Developer.
            </h1>

            <p class="infoMeText">
                I studied Translation and Interpreting and I have been working as a freelance translator for the last 2 years. </br>
                My specialization is legal translation and conference interpreting. When I lived in Brussels I had the chance</br>
                to work for the European Parliament and I also did an internship at the European Commission. </br>
                My work languages are Spanish, English and French.
            </p>

            <p class="infoMeText">
                I was searching for new horizons and challenges, so I decided to study a Full Stack Developer course<br> 
                at Geeks Hubs in September 2020.
            </p>

            <p class="infoMeText">
                I consider myself lucky to have always worked in a constantly changing international environment. <br> 
                This is because I am a very active person who is willing to learn things everyday. From my point of view, <br> 
                the ideal job I could apply for should have a bit of computers, languages and videogames, <br> 
                which are my three biggest passions in life.
            </p>
